Learning about using date objects, converting to and from strings, and
comparing dates for the first time was challenging. I found that converting 
everything to UTC midnight fixed bugs apparently associated with time zone issues.

Closest does not find display none dropdown content. I worked around this by
using closest to find the task id, corresponding to task array index number, and
then using queryselector('${task} .dropdown-content').

Implement different task views by project
    tasks dropdown assign project only assigns first task

Implement local storage

Style dropdown or add indicator to show which project it is assigned to

fix transition on load

remove crazy focus outline for new project & task buttons
