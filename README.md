Todos will be objects created by factories, with title, description, dueDate, priority, project?. Users can add these and assign to projects or default to Main List.

Projects will hold todos. There will be a default called Main List. Users can add projects and assign todos to projects.

Separate app logic from DOM manipulation into separate modules.

UI must include: 
view all projects, 
view all todos in each project
expand single todo to see/edit details
delete todo

Pseudocode:

Make a landing page html template and page switching for:
    view all projects (default view)
    view all todos in each project (modal)
    expand single todo to see/edit details (modal)
    delete todo (from proj view or todo view)
